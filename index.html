    <h2 class="Welcome">Hey I'm Linoy Noe Welcome to my profile</h2>

<p> Hi, I'm Linoy, 27 years old, I'll tell you a little about myself 
    and I'll focus on what I chose to study today and what I wish for 
    myself in the future.</p>

<br>

<p>After I was released from the army, I still didn't know what I wanted to study,
     so I didn't rush. I started working as a secretary in several large offices 
     (lawyers' office, insurance companies). A year after the liberation, 
     I went to Central America for three months.When I returned from the trip I went to work 
     again as a secretary and after about a year and a half the corona virus broke out. 
     For me, the corona virus was the sign I needed to gather myself and decide what career I want.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    At first I did a fitness trainer course because I really like this world,
     but when I realized what the consequences were and that it was more than my usual pleasure,
      I consulted the environment and especially myself and came to the conclusion that the 
      computer and digital world interests me so much that it is worth trying to succeed there.
    And that's how I started my software studies.
    I wish to myself that in a few years from now I will be happy and grateful for this choice :)
